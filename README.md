# Arinone's simple pythagorean calculation test software.

## Presentation

This software is an attempt to write my first Csharp program with Visual Studio and .NET WinForms libraries. I'm proud of finishing it in one day, and sure this program works, I tried it myself !

<sub> Also, sorry for my mediocre english, I'm not english native... </sub>

## Using the software

Once you open the software, you should see this window pop up :

You can enter the needed values in the given fields. Use the big right-triangle picture as the reference for putting your values.

<sub> Note : Just write the normal values, no need to pre-calculate their squares. </sub>

As you can see, you have 3 modes :

# Hypotenusis mode

This is the fundamentals of the pythagorean theorem. It simply calculates the hypotenusis's square with the sum of the 2 other length's square.

# Adjacent mode

This mode instead calculates AC's length (can be any value you want, it's just a referencement for this program). Input the hypotenusis & the other adjacent value.

# Reciprocal mode

This mode is basically Pythagore's reciprocal, which verifies if an triangle is rectangle by comparing the hypotenusis's square to the other two length's squares.
